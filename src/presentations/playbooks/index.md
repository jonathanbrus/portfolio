3. System Protocols (Playbooks)
   Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for repeatable, error-free execution.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Protocol

Tools: Terraform, AWS.

Process: Every environment (Dev, Staging, Prod) is provisioned via Terraform to ensure 100% environment parity and eliminate manual configuration risk.

Quality Assurance Protocol

Tools: ESLint, Prettier, Jest.

Process: Automated quality gates are enforced on every commit to ensure the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable by any team member.

Cross-Platform Deployment Protocol

Tools: Flutter, PWA, Docker.

Process: Utilizing Docker containers to standardize runtimes across web and mobile platforms, ensuring "write once, run anywhere" efficiency.
