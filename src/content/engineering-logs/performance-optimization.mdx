# Maximizing Speed: Performance Gains in Web & Mobile

## Situation

Large bundle sizes in the **Next.js** web portal and inefficient state management in the **Flutter** app were increasing latency.

## Task

Optimize for **Core Web Vitals** and mobile smoothness to deliver a lead-level user experience.

## Action

- **Next.js**: Implemented Server Components and dynamic imports to reduce initial JS payload by 35%.
- **Flutter**: Optimized widget builds and moved heavy data processing to background isolates.
- **MUI**: Standardized theme variables to reduce CSS-in-JS overhead.

## Result

- **Lighthouse Score**: Achieved 95+ across Performance and Accessibility.
- **Direct Impact**: Improved page load times directly correlate to higher conversion rates for product ideation phases.
