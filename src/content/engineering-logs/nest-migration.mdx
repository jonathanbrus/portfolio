# Standardizing Backend Architecture: The Move to Nest.js

## Situation

Managing multiple microservices in a high-growth startup environment led to "architectural drift". Every developer had a different pattern for Express.js controllers, making code reviews expensive and error-prone.

## Task

Implement a framework that enforces strict modularity and dependency injection to ensure the codebase remains **team-ready** and **scalable**.

## Action

I transitioned our core services to **Nest.js**.

- **Modular Design**: Encapsulated business logic into discrete modules.
- **Dependency Injection**: Decoupled services to make the system easier to test with **Jest**.
- **DTO Validation**: Leveraged class-validator to ensure data integrity before it reaches the **MongoDB** layer.

## Result

- **Autonomy**: New engineers contribute to production within 48 hours without architectural hand-holding.
- **Reliability**: Reduced runtime errors by 25% through strict TypeScript enforcement.

| Metric          | Express.js | Nest.js      |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :----------- |
| **Scalability** | Low        | **High**     |
| **Maintenance** | Medium     | **Low**      |
| **ROI**         | Neutral    | **Positive** |
