# Financial Engineering: Reducing Cloud Overhead by 30%

## Situation

Unmanaged AWS resource allocation was creating "financial leakages." Manual provisioning resulted in orphaned volumes and over-provisioned RDS instances.

## Task

Apply a **survivalist approach** to infrastructure—treat every AWS dollar as a transaction that must be optimized.

## Action

I refactored our cloud footprint using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

- **Automated Shutdowns**: Scripted non-production environments to terminate outside 9-6 working hours.
- **Right-Sizing**: Utilized CloudWatch metrics to downgrade underutilized EC2 and RDS instances.
- **Containerization**: Shifted sporadic workloads to **Docker** on AWS Fargate to pay only for exact execution time.

## Result

- **Debt Reduction**: Immediate reduction in monthly burn rate, redirecting $14k+ annually back to capital reserves.
- **Environment Parity**: 100% consistency across Dev, Staging, and Prod.
